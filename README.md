# lem-in
A riff on the classic 90s video game. Developers design their own implementation of Dijkstra’s pathfinding algorithm in C. This algorithm analyzes a unique input with a variable number of ants and then helps the colony navigate from the start of a maze to the end. Solutions tend to start off single-pathed. However, as software developers revise their code, solvers become multi-pathed, recursive, and weighted for distance or number of hops. All solutions involve rigorous input validation, algorithmic optimization, and a graphical output to watch the ants find their home.

## Allowed functions:
`malloc`, `free`, `perror`, `strerror`, `read`, `write`, `exit`.
## Keywords
C language, problem solving, pathfinding, Dijkstra’s algorithm, efficiency, optimization.
